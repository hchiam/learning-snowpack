# Learning snowpack

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Only build a file once, and only rebuild it _**if it changes**_, instead of rebuilding on every change and going through the dependency graph - this means build times don't increase with your project size; [sounds like the future of web dev (compared to webpack, parcel, and rollup)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IG4UmULyoA).

## New notes:

From scratch: (set up package.json and index.html and then run bash commands)

```bash
npm init
yarn add --dev snowpack
yarn add react react-dom
yarn start
```

Using this repo:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

If you're using purely `npm` and not `yarn`, you can easily figure out the equivalent `npm` commands: <https://github.com/hchiam/learning-yarn>

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.

## Or just

```bash
npx snowpack-init my-app; cd my-app; npm run start
# (watch for any option prompts that you need to respond to)
```

## Or use CSA

Svelte template: <https://github.com/pikapkg/create-snowpack-app/tree/master/templates/app-template-svelte>

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app new-dir --template @snowpack/app-template-svelte --use-yarn
```

(Note to self: the steps after didn't seem to work for me when I last tried.)
